reporting = [(2, 1), (6, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 6), (8, 6), (7, 2), (9, 6), (10, 6)]
info_exch = [(3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (3, 2), (5, 6), (10, 6), (3, 10), (2, 1), (6, 1), (2, 6)]
```

tasks = ["A", "B", "C"]
tech_deps = [("A", "B"), ("B", "C")]
```

teams = ["X", "Y", "Z"]
```

#### Employee - team affiliations

emp_team = [("X", 3), ("X", 4), ("X", 7), ("Y", 5), ("Y", 8), ("Y", 9), ("Y", 10), ("Z", 4), ("Z", 7), ("Z", 5), ("Z", 8)]
