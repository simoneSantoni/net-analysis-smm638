## Overview

This week shifts focus from individual nodes and local structures to
understanding networks at a higher level of abstraction, a critical skill for
analyzing complex organizational and market systems. We explore two
complementary approaches to seeing social structure, drawing on foundational
sociological theory:

1.  **Connectionist approaches**: Focusing on **social cohesion** and the
formation of communities through direct ties and resource flows. This view
aligns with Durkheim's concept of solidarity, asking what holds groups together.
In a business context, this helps identify siloed departments, informal
communication clusters, and the robustness of information flow.  

2. **Positional approaches**: Focusing on **roles and positions** that emerge
through similar patterns of ties (structural equivalence). This abstracts away
from *who* knows *whom* to *what* function an actor serves (e.g., "broker,"
"leader," "isolate"). This is essential for organizational design, identifying
redundant roles, and understanding power dynamics beyond simple hierarchy.

These perspectives help us address fundamental questions about social
integration and structure: How do we identify meaningful subgroups? How do role
structures organize economic and social life? And how can these insights drive 
strategic decision-making?

## 📚

📖 **Review**:

-   [Network fundamentals](../week-1/network_terms.qmd) (Week 1)
-   [Centrality measures](../week-3/slideshow.html) (Week 3)
-   [Triadic structures](../week-4/slideshow.html) (Week 4)

📖 **Required Readings**:

**Chapter 8: "Cohesion and Groups"** (Rawlings et al., 2023)

*Focus on:*

-   **Ridge Structures**: How networks are composed of peaks of high
connectivity and ridges of lower connectivity.

-   **Modularity**: The measure of the strength of division of a network into
modules (communities).

-   **Small Worlds**: The balance between local clustering and global
reachability, and its implication for diffusion (e.g., of innovation or risk).

**Chapter 10: "Positions and Roles"** (Rawlings et al., 2023)

*Focus on:*

-   **Structural Equivalence**: Actors who have identical ties to and from all
other actors.

-   **Regular Equivalence**: Actors who have ties to *equivalent* others (e.g.,
two managers may not know the same people, but they both supervise employees and
report to directors).

-   **Blockmodeling**: The inductive method for identifying these roles from
data.

-   **Metric Analysis**: Using Modularity and Normalized Mutual Information
(NMI) to validate cluster quality.

-   **Stability Testing**: Assessing if your identified segments are robust or
artifacts of the data.

-   **Business Case**: Identifying distinct communities in a client network.

### Tutorial 2: [Community Detection in Python](practice_2.qmd)

Parallel tutorial using Python/NetworkX:

-   **Greedy Modularity & Label Propagation**: Fast methods for large-scale
networks.

-   **Visualizing Communities**: Producing clear reports for stakeholders.

-   **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmarking methods to select the best fit for
your data.

### Tutorial 3: [Role and Position Analysis in R](practice_3.qmd)

Advanced tutorial on Blockmodeling and Structural Equivalence:

-   **Identifying Roles**: Using CONCOR and hierarchical clustering to find
actors with similar behavioral profiles.

-   **Image Matrices**: Creating simplified maps of how roles interact (e.g.,
"How does Sales interact with Engineering?").

-   **Model Fit**: Evaluating how well your reduced model represents the complex
reality.

-   **Application**: Analyzing a corporate advice network to identify key
influencers and bottlenecks.

**Application Exercises**:

1.  **Organizational Silo Analysis**: Apply community detection algorithms to an
internal communication network. Identify if the communities map to formal
departments or if cross-functional silos exist. Discuss the implications for
organizational agility.

2.  **Role Identification in Supply Chains**: Perform a blockmodeling analysis
on a supply chain network. Identify positions (e.g., "primary suppliers",
"assemblers", "distributors") based on transaction patterns rather than labels.
Create an image matrix to show the flow of goods between these positions.

3.  **Structural Integration**: Examine the intersection of communities and
roles. Do "brokers" (a positional role) tend to exist at the boundaries of
communities? How does this affect information diffusion?

### Discussion Questions

**1. Mechanical vs. Organic Solidarity in Modern Firms**
Durkheim distinguished between mechanical solidarity (based on similarity) and
organic solidarity (based on interdependence). How do **communities** (clusters
of dense ties) and **role structures** (interdependent positions) map onto these
concepts? Which form of solidarity is more prevalent in a startup vs. a large
bureaucracy?

**2. The "Small World" of Business**
Watts and Strogatz (1998) showed that a few random links can drastically reduce
the diameter of a network. In a business context, what are the risks and
benefits of a "small world" network? Consider the spread of innovation vs. the
spread of systemic risk (e.g., financial contagion).

**3. Methodological Pluralism**
Why is there no single "best" algorithm for community detection? What does this
imply about the nature of social groups? As an analyst, how do you justify your
choice of method to a stakeholder who wants "the right answer"?
