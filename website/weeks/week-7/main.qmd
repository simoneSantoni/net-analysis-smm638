## Overview

This week shifts focus from individual nodes and local structures to
understanding networks at a higher level of abstraction. We explore two
complementary approaches to seeing social structure:

1. **Connectionist approaches**: How cohesive communities form through direct
   ties and resource flows
2. **Positional approaches**: How roles and positions emerge through similar
   patterns of ties

These perspectives help us address fundamental questions about social
integration: What holds groups together? How do we identify meaningful
subgroups? How do role structures organize social life?

## 💻

### Tutorial 1: [Community Detection in R](practice_1.qmd)

A comprehensive tutorial covering:

- **Multiple algorithms**: Louvain, Edge Betweenness, Walktrap, Spectral, Fast Greedy
- **Method comparison**: Calculate and compare modularity scores across methods
- **Agreement analysis**: Use Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) to assess method consistency
- **Quality assessment**: Analyze within vs. between community density
- **Resolution exploration**: Sweep resolution parameters to find optimal granularity
- **Stability testing**: Assess robustness to network perturbations
- **Visualization**: Create publication-quality community structure plots
- **Hands-on examples**: Karate Club network and scale-free networks

### Tutorial 2: [Community Detection in Python](practice_2.qmd)

A parallel tutorial using Python and NetworkX that demonstrates:

- Loading and exploring networks in Python
- Applying greedy modularity, label propagation, and Girvan-Newman algorithms
- Optionally running Louvain (if `python-louvain` is installed)
- Computing modularity using `networkx.algorithms.community`
- Visualizing communities with Matplotlib
- Comparing methods via a modularity summary table and bar plot
- Applying methods to both the karate club graph and a larger scale-free network

### Tutorial 3: [Role and Position Analysis in R](practice_3.qmd)

A comprehensive tutorial covering blockmodeling and structural equivalence:

- **Structural equivalence measures**: Correlation and Euclidean distance
- **CONCOR algorithm**: Classical blockmodeling approach
- **Hierarchical clustering**: Identifying positions from tie profiles
- **Blockmodels and image matrices**: Reduced network representations
- **Block density analysis**: Within vs. between position densities
- **Multiple methods comparison**: Comparing different equivalence measures
- **Model fit assessment**: Evaluating blockmodel quality
- **Practical examples**: Corporate advice networks and organizational hierarchies
- **Substantive interpretation**: Understanding role meanings

### Advanced Topics (Coming Soon)

- Small-world analysis and metrics
- Cohesive blocking and k-components
- Dynamic community detection
- Overlapping community detection

## Perform

## 📝

**Application exercises**:

1. **Community Analysis**: Apply multiple community detection algorithms to a
   network and compare results. Assess which method best captures substantive
communities.

2. **Role Structure Analysis**: Perform a blockmodeling analysis to identify
   role positions in an organizational or social network. Create and interpret
the image matrix.

3. **Integration**: Examine whether communities correspond to positions - do
   structurally equivalent actors tend to be in the same community?

### Conceptual Connections

**Mechanical vs. Organic Solidarity**

Consider how Durkheim's distinction between mechanical solidarity (based on
similarity) and organic solidarity (based on differentiated interdependence)
maps onto the distinction between communities and role structures.

**Methodological Pluralism**

Reflect on why there is no single "best" method for community detection or
blockmodeling. What does this tell us about the nature of social structure?

**Integration of Approaches**

How might communities and positions relate to each other? Can structurally
equivalent actors be in different communities? Can community members occupy
different positions?
