## Exercise Overview

**Task:** Calculate centrality measures for a collaboration network and interpret the results.

**Network Description:**

- 15-node collaboration network
- Undirected edges (mutual relationships)
- Nodes represent team members
- Edges represent working relationships

## Questions

1. Which node has the highest **degree centrality**?
2. Which node has the highest **betweenness centrality**?
3. Which node has the highest **closeness centrality**?
4. Which nodes have the highest **clustering coefficient**?
5. How do these metrics correlate with each other?
