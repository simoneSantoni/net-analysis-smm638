## The RBC Challenge

**Context: First-Party Fraud Detection**

- RBC: Canada's largest bank with 15+ million clients, 6.5M cards
- **Problem**: Detecting fraudulent credit applications by own customers
- **Traditional approach**: Rule-based systems with **85:1 false positive ratio**
- **Cost**: $10M upfront + $1M annual maintenance + 30TB weekly data processing

**McKenzie's Mission: Reduce false positives from 85:1 to 10:1**

::: {.callout-important}
**The Connected Explosion**: "Ten fraudsters sharing 10 common data elements can create 100 false identities; if they defraud 4 financial instruments per identity with $5,000 credit limit, potential loss = **$2 million**"

## Why Networks Detect Fraud Better

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-important}
**Traditional Fraud Detection Limitations:**

Individual attribute checking misses organized fraud patterns:

- Credit scores, income verification, address validation
- Each application evaluated in isolation
- Fraudsters exploit this independence
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-tip}
**Network Analysis Advantage:**

Reveals the **connected explosion** - fraudsters' coordination creates detectable signatures:

- Shared phone numbers across multiple applications
- Common email domains and IP addresses
- Linked banking activities and transactions
- Connected social security numbers and addresses

## Fraudsters Face a Paradox

::: {.callout-note}

Fraudsters' greatest strength (coordination) becomes their **Achilles' heel** (detectability through network patterns)

## The Analytical Challenge

**16 Fraud Detection Rules Applied to 13,731 Customers**

**Key Performance Metrics:**

| Rule | Positive Hits | True Positives | Detection Rate | False Positive Rate |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| R1   | 3,221         | 189 (45.5%)    | 45.5%          | 17:1                |
| R27  | 2,057         | 169 (40.7%)    | 40.7%          | 12:1                |
| R18  | 9,107         | 84 (20.2%)     | 20.2%          | **108:1** ⚠️        |

::: {.callout-caution}

**The Core Trade-off:**

- Higher detection rate → More false positives → Higher investigation costs
- Lower false positive rate → Fewer fraudsters caught → Higher fraud losses

**Neither single rule achieves the 10:1 target**

## Business Value: Three Critical Insights {.smaller}

**1. Precision Enhancement Through Combined Rules**

- **Logit model** combining 16 rules outperforms any single rule
- Achieves **2.7:1 false positive ratio** at optimal threshold (0.275)
- Trade-off: Only 13% detection rate at lowest FP ratio
- **Sweet spot**: 80% detection (330/415 fraudsters) at 10:1 ratio (threshold = 0.05)

**2. Cost-Benefit Analysis**

Must balance:
- Average cost of undetected fraudster ($2M potential loss per ring)
- Average cost per investigation ($500-2000 per positive hit)
- Data processing costs (ETL: 30TB weekly, 5 days processing time)

**3. System Performance Optimization**

- **Real-time vs. batch processing**: 5-day lag creates vulnerability window
- **Super clusters**: Everyone-connected-to-everyone formations require threshold tuning
- **Scalability**: Managing millions of accounts with complex network algorithms

## What Business Analysts Must Understand {.smaller}

**The Multi-Dimensional Optimization Problem:**

**Technical Dimensions:**

- Feature engineering from network patterns
- Model performance (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Computational efficiency and scalability

**Business Dimensions:**

- Customer experience (minimizing false accusations)
- Operational efficiency (investigation team capacity)
- Financial impact (fraud losses vs. prevention costs)

**Strategic Dimensions:**

- System evolution as fraudsters adapt
- Integration with legacy banking systems
- Regulatory compliance and data privacy

::: {.callout-tip}
**Real Outcome**: By end of 2015, RBC reduced false positive ratio to 24:1 (progress but still above 10:1 target). In March 2016, discontinued SNA to revamp ETL infrastructure.

## Key Lessons for Analysts {.smaller}

**1. Context Matters More Than Algorithms**

- Best model must align with business constraints
- Pure accuracy is not the goal—balanced performance is

**2. Trade-offs Are Inherent**

- Detection rate vs. false positive rate
- Thoroughness vs. operational efficiency  
- Real-time responsiveness vs. computational cost

**3. Network Analysis Reveals Hidden Patterns**

- Individual-level analysis misses organized fraud
- Connectivity is both the crime's structure and its detection mechanism
- Network thinking transforms how we identify risk

::: {.callout-note}
This case demonstrates why business analysts need both technical skills (modeling, optimization) and business judgment (trade-off management, stakeholder communication)
