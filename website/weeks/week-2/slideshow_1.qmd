## What Are Networks?

**Networks are structures of interconnected entities**

- Entities are interconnected via specific **relationships**
- **Examples of relationships** are:
  - Resource flow (e.g., economic exchange)
  - Information exchange (e.g., electronic communication)
  - Physical connection (e.g., London tube)
  - Membership (e.g., student-program affiliation)

::: {.callout-note}
*Networks and graphs are interrelated yet distinct concepts*: graphs are
mathematical constructs, while networks regard concrete relationships between
entities that can be represented using graphs
