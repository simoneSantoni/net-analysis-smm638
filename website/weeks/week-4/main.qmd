**From Building Blocks to Network Structure**

Reflect on how dyadic and triadic patterns aggregate to form larger network structures:

- **Dyadic reciprocity**: Why do some networks have high reciprocity while others don't? What does this reveal about relationship formation?
- **Triadic closure**: How does the principle "friends of friends become friends" shape network evolution? When might this principle fail?
- **Network dynamics**: How do local interaction patterns (dyads and triads) create emergent global network properties?

Consider examples: professional networks (weak reciprocity, strategic triads), romantic relationships (high reciprocity, exclusive triads), or collaboration networks (project-based triads).
