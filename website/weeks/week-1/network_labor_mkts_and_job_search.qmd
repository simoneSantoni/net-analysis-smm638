# Reflection Exercise

Imagine you are actively searching for a new job in your field. Reflect on your interpersonal network and consider the following questions:

1. **How could your personal and professional connections facilitate your job search?**
   Consider the direct and indirect ways your network might help you discover opportunities, gain introductions, or learn about organizations.

2. **Which specific contacts would be most valuable in this process, and why?**
   Think about what makes certain connections particularly helpful. Consider factors such as:
   - Their industry knowledge or position
   - The strength of your relationship with them
   - The breadth and quality of their network
   - Their willingness and ability to advocate for you

3. **What patterns do you notice about the most valuable connections?**
   Reflect on whether proximity, trust, expertise, or other factors determine a connection's utility in job search contexts.
