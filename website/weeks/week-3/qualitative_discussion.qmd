## Slide 1: The Strategic Context {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
### Space Games Inc.'s Challenge

**Company Background**
- Small gaming company in Singapore
- Launching "Thrive in Space 5" (5th version)
- Target: Gamers aged 16-25
- Campaign: "Thrive to Survive" on Twitch
- Timeline: 1 month to launch

**CMO Tina Lohn's Dilemma**

Three critical questions facing senior management:

1. **Selection**: Which influencers should we choose?
2. **Justification**: How do we prove ROI to leadership?
3. **Methodology**: What metrics actually matter?
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## The Core Problem
**Follower count alone is misleading**

Traditional metrics don't reveal:
- Who influences other influencers?
- Who bridges multiple communities?
- Who has authentic audience engagement?
- Who aligns with brand values?
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Why This Matters
Failed influencer campaigns often result from poor selection, regardless of budget size

## Slide 2: Understanding Twitch's Unique Value {.smaller}

### Why Twitch for Gaming Products?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Platform Characteristics

**Live Streaming Advantage**
- Real-time product demonstrations
- Authentic, unscripted reactions
- High interactivity (chat features)
- Community trust and credibility

**Audience Demographics** 
- 73% aged 16-34 (perfect fit!)
- 65% male, 35% female
- Gaming-focused community
- High engagement rates

**Monetization Ready**
- Affiliate program structure
- Subscription revenue models
- Donation capabilities
- Professional content creators
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Network Structure Insights

**Key Finding**: Network is **dense with distinct super-users**

- Average followers: 6.22 per user
- Maximum followers: 465 (User 4949)
- Distribution highly skewed
- Sub-communities within larger network

**Strategic Implications**:

1. Few users have outsized influence
2. Communities cluster around topics
3. Information spreads through hubs
4. Super-users bridge multiple groups

::: {.callout-tip}
## Business Opportunity
Select influencers who are **well-connected** within the network, not just those with high follower counts
:::
:::
:::

## Slide 3: Strategic Selection Framework {.smaller}

### Moving Beyond Simple Metrics

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
## Critical Business Insight
**Network position matters more than network size**

An influencer connected to other influential users has multiplier effects that raw follower count misses
:::

### Three-Stage Selection Process

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Stage 1: Apply Business Filters

**Remove Misaligned Candidates**

✗ **Mature Content Channels**
  - Not age-appropriate for 16+ game
  - Brand safety concerns
  - Reduced candidate pool by 55%

✓ **Require Affiliate Status** 
  - Professional monetization capability
  - Experience with sponsored content
  - FTC disclosure compliance
  - Only 5% of streamers qualify

**Result**: Initial filtering based on business requirements, not just network metrics

#### Stage 2: Network Analysis

**Identify True Influencers**

Focus on two key dimensions:

**Eigenvector Centrality** (High)
- Connected to other influential streamers
- Message spreads through important nodes
- Access to influential audiences
- **Business Value**: Credibility by association

**Betweenness Centrality** (High)
- Bridges multiple gaming communities
- Facilitates cross-community reach
- Information gatekeeper role
- **Business Value**: Broader market penetration

**Ideal Quadrant**: High Eigenvector + High Betweenness

**Result**: 14 candidates from network analysis

#### Stage 3: Qualitative Validation

**Profile Checks for Final Selection**

**Genre Alignment**
- Plays games similar to Thrive in Space?
- Space/strategy game background?
- Audience interested in multiplayer games?

**Content Style**
- Multi-game streamers (more credible)
- Professional streaming quality
- Positive community management
- Consistent schedule

**Authenticity Markers**
- Genuine enthusiasm for games
- No controversial associations
- Values align with Space Games Inc.
- History of successful partnerships

**Final Selection**: Choose 3 influencers from **different communities**
