## The Strategic Context {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
### Space Games Inc.'s Challenge

**Company Background**

- Small gaming company in Singapore
- Launching "Thrive in Space 5" (5th version)
- Target: Gamers aged 16-25
- Campaign: "Thrive to Survive" on Twitch
- Timeline: 1 month to launch

**CMO Tina Lohn's Dilemma**

Three critical questions facing senior management:

1. **Selection**: Which influencers should we choose?
2. **Justification**: How do we prove ROI to leadership?
3. **Methodology**: What metrics actually matter?
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## The Core Problem
**Follower count alone is misleading**

Traditional metrics don't reveal:

- Who influences other influencers?
- Who bridges multiple communities?
- Who has authentic audience engagement?
- Who aligns with brand values?
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Why This Matters
Failed influencer campaigns often result from poor selection, regardless of budget size

### Moving Beyond Simple Metrics
