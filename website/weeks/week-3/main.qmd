## 📚

📖 Review [Week 2 slideshows](../week-2/main.qmd#participate) on network centrality

📖 Revise centrality measures: degree, closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality

🙋 **Case Discussion**: "Who Is the Right Influencer? A Social Network Analysis"

This week we focus on applying centrality concepts through case study discussion.

**Materials**:

- Electronic copy of the case available in Moodle's "case studies" section
- [Qualitative discussion of the case (made available after the class)](qualitative_discussion.qmd)
:::

## Practice

::: {.callout-note}
##  💻

**Hands-on Analysis**: Explore the Twitch dataset to understand node attributes before applying centrality measures

- [Exploratory data analysis of Twitch gamers](gamers_eda.qmd)

:::

## Perform

##  📝

**Assignment**: [Influencer Selection for Space Games Inc.](perform.qmd)

Apply the strategic framework from the Twitch case discussion to identify optimal influencers using R network analysis.

**Centrality Measures: Commonalities and Differences**

Reflect on the four centrality measures discussed (degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector):

- **Commonalities**: What do all centrality measures attempt to capture? How do they help identify important nodes?
- **Differences**: When would you choose one measure over another? What unique insights does each provide?
- **Trade-offs**: Can a node rank high on one measure but low on another? What does this tell us?

Consider real-world examples: social media influencers (degree vs. eigenvector), transportation hubs (betweenness), or emergency response networks (closeness).
