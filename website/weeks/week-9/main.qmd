## Overview

This week addresses one of the central questions in network analytics: **When do
networks create value?** We explore how structural position translates into
tangible outcomes for individuals and organizations, drawing on two foundational
theories of social capital:

1.  **Bonding Social Capital (Coleman)**: Dense, closed networks create value
through **trust** and cooperation. When your contacts know each other,
reputation effects operate, social norms can be enforced, and cheating becomes
costly. This is the theory of *network closure*.

2.  **Bridging Social Capital (Burt)**: Sparse networks with *structural holes*
create value through access to **diverse information** and brokerage
opportunities. Individuals who span disconnected groups gain early access to
non-redundant information and strategic control over information flows.

These perspectives represent a fundamental tension in network strategy: closure
provides safety and trust, while brokerage provides opportunity and innovation.
The optimal structure depends on what you are trying to achieve.

## 📚

📖 **Review**:

-   [Network fundamentals](../week-1/network_terms.qmd) (Week 1)
-   [Centrality measures](../week-3/main.qmd) (Week 3) — especially betweenness
centrality
-   [Communities and cohesion](../week-7/main.qmd) (Week 7)

📖 **Required Readings**:

**Burt, R. S. (2004). "Structural Holes and Good Ideas."** *American Journal of
Sociology*, 110(2), 349-399.

*Focus on:*

-   **Structural holes**: The "empty space" between disconnected groups that
creates brokerage opportunities
-   **Information benefits**: How brokers access diverse, non-redundant
knowledge before others
-   **Good ideas**: Evidence that network position predicts idea quality and
career success

**Coleman, J. S. (1988). "Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital."**
*American Journal of Sociology*, 94, S95-S120.

*Focus on:*

-   **Closure and trust**: How dense networks enable cooperation and reduce
transaction costs
-   **Reputation effects**: Why cheating becomes costly when mutual friends can
observe and sanction
-   **Norm enforcement**: How closed networks establish and maintain shared
expectations

📉 Slideshow: [When Do Networks Create Value?](slideshow.html)

This presentation covers:

-   The theoretical framework: social capital vs. social homogeneity
-   Bonding social capital: network closure and the Coleman perspective
-   Bridging social capital: structural holes and the Burt framework
-   Measuring closure (clustering coefficient) and brokerage (betweenness,
constraint)
-   Business applications: fraud detection, organizational networks, and board
interlocks
-   The strategic tension between safety (closure) and opportunity (brokerage)

**Hands-on Analysis**: Measuring social capital and brokerage

Apply the concepts from this week to analyze network position and its
relationship to performance:

**Exercise 1: Clustering and Closure**

Using the network datasets from previous weeks, calculate and interpret:

-   Local clustering coefficients for each node
-   Network-level average clustering
-   Compare clustering across different types of networks (social vs.
information vs. collaboration)

**Exercise 2: Brokerage Position**

Identify brokers and structural holes:

-   Calculate betweenness centrality to find nodes on shortest paths
-   Compute Burt's constraint index to measure structural hole access
-   Visualize brokerage positions by coloring nodes by constraint level

**Exercise 3: Position-Performance Relationship**

If your network has performance data (e.g., sales, ratings, influence):

-   Correlate network position metrics with performance outcomes
-   Test whether brokers outperform actors in closed networks (or vice versa)
-   Consider what contextual factors might moderate these relationships

**Application Exercise: Network Audit**

Choose an organization or professional context you are familiar with (your
workplace, a student organization, an industry you follow):

1.  **Map the informal network**: Sketch the key actors and their connections
(you don't need complete data—use your intuition about who interacts with whom)

2.  **Identify brokers**: Who spans different groups? Who has access to diverse
information sources?

3.  **Identify closed clusters**: Which groups have dense internal connections?
Where might trust be highest?

4.  **Strategic implications**: Based on your analysis:
    -   What are the risks if key brokers leave?
    -   Where might silos be limiting information flow?
    -   How could the network be restructured to improve performance?

Bring your analysis to class for discussion.

### Discussion Questions

**1. The Closure-Brokerage Trade-off**

Burt argues for the value of structural holes; Coleman emphasizes closure. Are
these perspectives contradictory, or can they be reconciled? Consider: Under
what conditions would you advise an actor to invest in bridging ties vs.
strengthening existing relationships?

**2. Dark Sides of Social Capital**

Both closure and brokerage have potential downsides:

-   Closed networks can become insular, resistant to change, and exclusionary
-   Brokers may exploit information asymmetries or face burnout from bridging
demands

How should organizations manage these risks while capturing network value?

**3. Network Position and Ethics**

The RBC fraud detection case shows how network analysis can identify criminal
behavior. But similar techniques could be used to:

-   Identify union organizers or whistleblowers
-   Target vulnerable individuals for manipulation
-   Reinforce existing power imbalances

What ethical guidelines should govern the use of network analytics in
organizations?

**4. Building Your Network Strategically**

Based on this week's material, how would you approach building your own
professional network? Should you focus on:

-   Deepening existing relationships (closure)?
-   Reaching out to new, distant contacts (brokerage)?
-   Some combination depending on context?
