- Growth rate in follower connections

**2. Content Propagation Patterns:**
- Repost cascade depth and speed
- Cross-community engagement (genre boundary spanning)
- Comment sentiment velocity
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**3. Community Structure Evolution:**
- New sub-communities forming around emerging genres
- Genre boundary shifts and fusion patterns
- Influencer migration between communities

**4. Engagement Network Dynamics:**
- Abnormal engagement patterns for new creators
- Playlist inclusion by high-centrality curators
- Discovery source diversity (beyond just feeds)
:::
:::

**Key Insight:** Network position often predicts viral potential before content quality metrics do.
