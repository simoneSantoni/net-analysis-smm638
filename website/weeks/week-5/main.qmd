📖 Review [Week 4 materials](../week-4/main.qmd) on dyads, triads, and network dynamics

📖 Revise theoretical concepts: dyadic reciprocity, triadic closure, and network evolution

🙋 **Case Discussion**: Applying dyadic and triadic analysis to real-world networks

This week we focus on applying dyadic and triadic concepts through case study discussion.

**From Theory to Practice: Network Dynamics in Action**

Reflect on how dyadic and triadic patterns shape network evolution in organizational contexts:

- **Reciprocity dynamics**: How do reciprocal relationships form and persist in professional networks? What factors promote or inhibit reciprocity?
- **Triadic closure processes**: In what contexts does triadic closure accelerate network formation? When might it create insularity or echo chambers?
- **Temporal patterns**: How do networks evolve over time? What triggers rapid structural change versus gradual evolution?

Consider applications: knowledge sharing networks (expertise flow), inter-organizational collaborations (strategic partnerships), or innovation networks (idea diffusion).
