## 📚

📖 Review [Week 7 materials](../week-7/main.qmd) on cohesion, community detection, and attention-based segmentation

📖 Read the case study: **"Fuller's and the Problem of Market Segmentation in the Beer Market"** (`ba_case.pdf`)

📌 Focus on Exhibits 2-4: contrasts between traditional vs. network-based segmentation, the two-mode user-style representation, and the three strategic options

📝 Jot down where BeerAdvocate attention data could reveal segments that Fuller's current research misses

🙋 **Case Discussion**: Fuller's attention-based segmentation dilemma

Sarah Mitchell and James Chen must choose how to re-segment the beer market as craft, imports, and digital discovery squeeze Fuller's "middle" position. The board needs evidence that attention networks from BeerAdvocate can guide portfolio and brand decisions.

**Key Discussion Questions**:

- What signals about loyalty, exploration, and cross-over styles are invisible to traditional focus groups and surveys?
- How would you build and validate a two-mode network (users ↔ beer styles) from BeerAdvocate, and what biases/coverage limits should Fuller's anticipate?
- Compare Options 1-3 (enhanced traditional research, network analysis pilot, integrated platform): which path fits Fuller's risk tolerance, timeline, and capability needs?
- How could attention communities translate into concrete moves (range rationalization, innovation briefs, pub assortment, messaging) for London Pride, ESB, and newer styles?
- If you recommend a pilot, what success metrics and governance would make the board confident to scale?

**Hands-on Analysis: Attention-based segmentation**

**📊 [BeerAdvocate Network Analysis](network_analysis.qmd)**

Explore how attention flows across beer styles and communities of enthusiasts:

- Build the two-mode user-style network and project it to a user-only network
- Run community detection to surface attention clusters and interpret "taste brokers"
- Compare degree, betweenness, and clustering to spot core vs. peripheral styles and users
- Experiment with different time windows or style groupings to test segmentation stability

**Case Prep (bring to class)**

- Choose your preferred option (1: enhanced traditional, 2: network pilot, 3: integrated platform) with 2-3 bullets of rationale
- Outline the minimum viable pilot: data scope, metrics of success, and how insights would feed portfolio decisions
- Note the biggest risks (selection bias, capability gaps, cost/pace) and how you would mitigate them

## Ponder

## 🤔

**Attention, community, and heritage**

- How does segmenting on shared attention (communities of discussion) differ from demographics or occasions, and when is each lens most actionable?
- Where might "taste brokers" who bridge styles signal early shifts in demand, and how could Fuller's engage them?
- How can a heritage brand balance authenticity with experiments prompted by online community signals?
- What safeguards are needed when blending public community data with proprietary sales and pub insights?
