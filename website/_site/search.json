A: Basic programming experience in R or Python is helpful but not required. We’ll cover the essentials for network analysis.\nQ: Can I use AI tools like ChatGPT? A: You may use them for learning and understanding concepts, but submitted work must be your own. Always cite any AI assistance received.\nQ: What if I’m falling behind? A: Seek help immediately. Network analysis concepts build on each other, so early gaps become bigger problems later.\nQ: Do I need a powerful computer? A: No, basic network analysis doesn’t require much computing power. Any computer from the last 5 years should work fine.\nQ: Should I use R or Python for network analysis? A: Both are excellent. We’ll primarily use R with igraph, but Python with NetworkX is also supported. Choose based on your comfort level.",

Conclusions & Business Impact\n\nKey Findings\n\nFramework Validation: The 2�2 framework (size � diversity) successfully identifies influencers with both reach and strategic positioning across multiple communities.\nQuality Over Quantity: Our analysis shows that qualified candidates in the optimal quadrant represent a small, strategic subset of all streamers, demonstrating that strategic network position is rare and valuable.\nPortfolio Approach: Top candidates span different communities, minimizing audience overlap and maximizing campaign reach.\nROI Potential: Conservative estimates project positive ROI with potential upside if network effects exceed expectations.\n\n\n\nStrategic Value Beyond ROI\nWhile ROI projections are positive, the strategic value extends beyond immediate sales:\n\nBrand Positioning: Association with trusted community voices builds long-term credibility\nMarket Intelligence: Direct feedback from influential gamers informs product development\nCommunity Building: Creates foundation for ongoing player engagement\nCompetitive Advantage: Early mover advantage in space strategy gaming segment on Twitch\n\n\n\nRisk Mitigation\nThe 2x2 framework approach mitigates several key risks:\n\nBrand Safety: Pre-filtering for non-mature content and professional status\nPortfolio Diversification: Multiple influencers across different communities\nStrategic Alignment: Focus on both reach (size) and impact (diversity)\nMeasurable Results: Performance-based contracts with clear attribution\n\n\n\nFinal Recommendation\nProceed with top 3 identified influencers, ensuring they span different communities for maximum reach and minimum overlap.\nBackup candidates provide contingency options if primary negotiations fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps for Space Games Inc.\n\n\n\n\nValidate Analysis: Conduct qualitative review of top candidates’ channels\nInitiate Contact: Reach out to top 3 + backups simultaneously\nNegotiate Contracts: Structure with base fee + performance bonuses\nPrepare Assets: Create influencer-specific game keys and discount codes\nMonitor & Optimize: Track performance and adjust strategy in real-time\n\nTimeline: Execute all phases within the 1-month window to launch deadline.\n\n\n\nAnalysis Framework: Network Size � Diversity (2�2 Strategic Framework) Course: SMM638 Network Analytics Case Study: Space Games Inc. - Twitch Influencer Campaign"

    "text": "Key Insights\nBased on this exploratory data analysis, we can identify several important patterns:\n\nUser Distribution: The platform shows a healthy 4:1 listener-to-creator ratio (75% listeners, 20% creators) with a small but active curator community (5%).\nContent Focus: The dataset has a strong hip-hop orientation with five main subgenres (Trap, Alternative Hip-Hop, Boom Bap, Lo-Fi, and SoundCloud Rap) dominating 81% of all content.\nEngagement Patterns: High engagement-to-play ratio suggests an active, invested community rather than passive consumption. Likes constitute 60% of engagements, followed by reposts (30%) and comments (10%).\nNetwork Structure: The follow network shows relatively egalitarian distribution with no extreme influencers - top users have only 18-20 followers in this sample.\nDiscovery Mechanisms: Users discover content through multiple channels: 44% direct access, 36% through playlists, and 20% via reposts.\nListening Behavior: The 48% average completion rate indicates users actively browse and sample tracks rather than listening to full songs consistently.\n\nThis dataset provides rich opportunities for network analysis, including: - Social network analysis of the follower graph - Bipartite network analysis of user-track interactions - Community detection in user and track networks - Influence propagation through reposts - Recommendation system development based on engagement patterns"
