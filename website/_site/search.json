A: Basic programming experience in R or Python is helpful but not required. We’ll cover the essentials for network analysis.\nQ: Can I use AI tools like ChatGPT? A: You may use them for learning and understanding concepts, but submitted work must be your own. Always cite any AI assistance received.\nQ: What if I’m falling behind? A: Seek help immediately. Network analysis concepts build on each other, so early gaps become bigger problems later.\nQ: Do I need a powerful computer? A: No, basic network analysis doesn’t require much computing power. Any computer from the last 5 years should work fine.\nQ: Should I use R or Python for network analysis? A: Both are excellent. We’ll primarily use R with igraph, but Python with NetworkX is also supported. Choose based on your comfort level.",

Conclusions & Business Impact\n\nKey Findings\n\nFramework Validation: The 2�2 framework (size � diversity) successfully identifies influencers with both reach and strategic positioning across multiple communities.\nQuality Over Quantity: Our analysis shows that qualified candidates in the optimal quadrant represent a small, strategic subset of all streamers, demonstrating that strategic network position is rare and valuable.\nPortfolio Approach: Top candidates span different communities, minimizing audience overlap and maximizing campaign reach.\nROI Potential: Conservative estimates project positive ROI with potential upside if network effects exceed expectations.\n\n\n\nStrategic Value Beyond ROI\nWhile ROI projections are positive, the strategic value extends beyond immediate sales:\n\nBrand Positioning: Association with trusted community voices builds long-term credibility\nMarket Intelligence: Direct feedback from influential gamers informs product development\nCommunity Building: Creates foundation for ongoing player engagement\nCompetitive Advantage: Early mover advantage in space strategy gaming segment on Twitch\n\n\n\nRisk Mitigation\nThe 2x2 framework approach mitigates several key risks:\n\nBrand Safety: Pre-filtering for non-mature content and professional status\nPortfolio Diversification: Multiple influencers across different communities\nStrategic Alignment: Focus on both reach (size) and impact (diversity)\nMeasurable Results: Performance-based contracts with clear attribution\n\n\n\nFinal Recommendation\nProceed with top 3 identified influencers, ensuring they span different communities for maximum reach and minimum overlap.\nBackup candidates provide contingency options if primary negotiations fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantNext Steps for Space Games Inc.\n\n\n\n\nValidate Analysis: Conduct qualitative review of top candidates’ channels\nInitiate Contact: Reach out to top 3 + backups simultaneously\nNegotiate Contracts: Structure with base fee + performance bonuses\nPrepare Assets: Create influencer-specific game keys and discount codes\nMonitor & Optimize: Track performance and adjust strategy in real-time\n\nTimeline: Execute all phases within the 1-month window to launch deadline.\n\n\n\nAnalysis Framework: Network Size � Diversity (2�2 Strategic Framework) Course: SMM638 Network Analytics Case Study: Space Games Inc. - Twitch Influencer Campaign"

The high engagement-to-play ratio suggests an invested community.\nNetwork Structure: The follow network shows a relatively balanced distribution with no extreme influencers in this sample (maximum 20 followers), suggesting either a niche community or a sample of regular users.\nDiscovery Patterns: Users discover content through multiple channels - 44% direct access, 36% through playlists, and 20% via reposts, indicating diverse discovery mechanisms.\nListening Behavior: The average completion rate of 48% suggests users actively browse and sample tracks rather than listening to complete songs, which is typical for music discovery platforms.\n\nThis dataset provides excellent opportunities for various network analyses including social network analysis, bipartite network modeling, community detection, and recommendation system development."

This baseline test shows whether the network is different from pure randomness.\nConditional Uniform Graph (CUG) Tests: A more stringent test that conditions on the observed edge count. This tests whether reciprocity and transitivity are higher/lower than expected given the network’s density.\n\nThe SoundCloud follow network shows:\n\nReciprocity: Similar to random expectations in both tests, indicating that mutual following rates are explained by network density alone.\nTransitivity: Similar to random expectations in both tests, suggesting that triangle formation is explained by edge density.\n\nThese results provide insight into whether the SoundCloud community exhibits structured social behavior (high reciprocity and transitivity) or more broadcast/consumption-oriented patterns (low reciprocity and transitivity)."
