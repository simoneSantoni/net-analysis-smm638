    "text": "What Are Networks?\nNetworks are structures of interconnected entities\n\nEntities are interconnected via specific relationships\nExamples of relationships are:\n\nResource flow (e.g., economic exchange)\nInformation exchange (e.g., electronic communication)\nPhysical connection (e.g., London tube)\nMembership (e.g., student-program affiliation)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNetworks and graphs are interrelated yet distinct concepts: graphs are mathematical constructs, while networks regard concrete relationships between entities that can be represented using graphs"
