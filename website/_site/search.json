A: You may use them for learning and understanding concepts, but submitted code must be your own work. Always cite any assistance received.\nQ: What if I’m falling behind? A: Seek help immediately. The course builds on itself, so early gaps become bigger problems later.\nQ: Do I need a powerful computer? A: No, basic Python programming doesn’t require much computing power. Any computer from the last 5 years should work fine.\nQ: Can I use a different IDE than recommended? A: Yes, but you’re responsible for any setup issues.
