A: Basic programming experience in R or Python is helpful but not required. We’ll cover the essentials for network analysis.\nQ: Can I use AI tools like ChatGPT? A: You may use them for learning and understanding concepts, but submitted work must be your own. Always cite any AI assistance received.\nQ: What if I’m falling behind? A: Seek help immediately. Network analysis concepts build on each other, so early gaps become bigger problems later.\nQ: Do I need a powerful computer? A: No, basic network analysis doesn’t require much computing power. Any computer from the last 5 years should work fine.\nQ: Should I use R or Python for network analysis? A: Both are excellent. We’ll primarily use R with igraph, but Python with NetworkX is also supported. Choose based on your comfort level.",

    "text": "Network Types\n\nOne-mode vs Two-mode Networks\n\nOne-mode Networks\nOne-mode networks (also called unipartite networks) contain only one type of vertex. All connections occur between vertices of the same type. Examples include:\n\nFriendship networks (people connected to people)\nCitation networks (papers citing papers)\nTrade networks (countries trading with countries)\n\nHere’s an example of creating a one-mode network visualization concerning a collaboration network among five co-workers:\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of a one-mode collaboration network showing connections between individuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected Vs Undirected Networks\nDirected networks (also called digraphs) have edges with a specific direction, indicating asymmetric relationships where the connection flows from one vertex to another. Examples include:\n\nEmail networks (sender → receiver)\nCitation networks (citing paper → cited paper)\n\nFood webs (predator → prey)\nTwitter follower networks (follower → followed)\n\nHere’s an example of a directed network:\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected Email Communication Network\n\n\n\n\nUndirected networks have edges without direction, representing symmetric relationships where connections are mutual. Examples include:\n\nFriendship networks (mutual friendships)\nCo-authorship networks (collaborations)\nInfrastructure networks (roads, power grids)\nProtein interaction networks\n\nThe choice between directed and undirected representation depends on whether the relationship being modeled is inherently asymmetric or symmetric.\n\n\nTwo-mode Networks\nTwo-mode networks (also called bipartite networks) contain two distinct types of vertices, and edges only connect vertices of different types. Examples include:\n\nActor-movie networks (actors connected to movies they appear in)\nAuthor-paper networks (authors connected to papers they wrote)\nCustomer-product networks (customers connected to products they purchased)\n\nHere’s an example of a two-mode purchasing network:\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Mode Customer-Product Purchasing Network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSigned Networks\nSigned networks are networks where edges carry positive or negative values, representing different types of relationships:\n\nPositive edges: friendship, alliance, cooperation\nNegative edges: animosity, conflict, competition\n\nSigned networks are particularly useful for studying:\n\nSocial balance theory\nCoalition formation\nConflict dynamics\nOpinion polarization\n\nHere’s an example of a signed social network like cooperative Vs. competitive ties among co-workers:\n\n\n\n\n\nSigned Social Network with Positive and Negative Relationships\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted vs Unweighted Networks\n\nWeighted Networks\nWeighted networks have edges with numerical values (weights) representing the strength, frequency, or capacity of connections. Examples include:\n\nCommunication networks (number of messages exchanged)\nTransportation networks (traffic volume or distance)\nNeural networks (synaptic strength)\nFinancial networks (transaction amounts)\n\nHere’s an example of a weighted communication network:\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted Communication Network (Edge Width = Message Volume)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnweighted Networks\nUnweighted networks (also called binary networks) have edges that simply indicate the presence or absence of a connection. All edges are treated equally, focusing on the topology rather than connection strength. These are simpler to analyze but may lose important information about relationship intensity."

In directed networks, dyads can be classified as:\n\nNull dyad: no connection in either direction\nAsymmetric dyad: connection in one direction only\nMutual/Reciprocal dyad: connections in both directions\n\nDyadic analysis examines pairwise relationships and forms the foundation for understanding reciprocity and basic network patterns.\nHere’s a visualization showing a dyad within a larger network:\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork with Emphasized Dyad (Alice-Bob)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTriads\nA triad consists of three vertices and the possible edges among them.
