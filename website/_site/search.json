A: Basic programming experience in R or Python is helpful but not required. We’ll cover the essentials for network analysis.\nQ: Can I use AI tools like ChatGPT? A: You may use them for learning and understanding concepts, but submitted work must be your own. Always cite any AI assistance received.\nQ: What if I’m falling behind? A: Seek help immediately. Network analysis concepts build on each other, so early gaps become bigger problems later.\nQ: Do I need a powerful computer? A: No, basic network analysis doesn’t require much computing power. Any computer from the last 5 years should work fine.\nQ: Should I use R or Python for network analysis? A: Both are excellent. We’ll primarily use R with igraph, but Python with NetworkX is also supported. Choose based on your comfort level.",

    "text": "Network Types\n\nOne-mode vs Two-mode Networks\n\nOne-mode Networks\nOne-mode networks (also called unipartite networks) contain only one type of vertex. All connections occur between vertices of the same type. Examples include:\n\nFriendship networks (people connected to people)\nCitation networks (papers citing papers)\nTrade networks (countries trading with countries)\n\nHere’s an example of creating a one-mode network visualization concerning a collaboration network among five co-workers:\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of a one-mode collaboration network showing connections between individuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected Vs Undirected Networks\nDirected networks (also called digraphs) have edges with a specific direction, indicating asymmetric relationships where the connection flows from one vertex to another. Examples include:\n\nEmail networks (sender → receiver)\nCitation networks (citing paper → cited paper)\n\nFood webs (predator → prey)\nTwitter follower networks (follower → followed)\n\nHere’s an example of a directed network:\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected Email Communication Network\n\n\n\n\nUndirected networks have edges without direction, representing symmetric relationships where connections are mutual. Examples include:\n\nFriendship networks (mutual friendships)\nCo-authorship networks (collaborations)\nInfrastructure networks (roads, power grids)\nProtein interaction networks\n\nThe choice between directed and undirected representation depends on whether the relationship being modeled is inherently asymmetric or symmetric.\n\n\nTwo-mode Networks\nTwo-mode networks (also called bipartite networks) contain two distinct types of vertices, and edges only connect vertices of different types. Examples include:\n\nActor-movie networks (actors connected to movies they appear in)\nAuthor-paper networks (authors connected to papers they wrote)\nCustomer-product networks (customers connected to products they purchased)\n\nHere’s an example of a two-mode purchasing network:\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Mode Customer-Product Purchasing Network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSigned Networks\nSigned networks are networks where edges carry positive or negative values, representing different types of relationships:\n\nPositive edges: friendship, alliance, cooperation\nNegative edges: animosity, conflict, competition\n\nSigned networks are particularly useful for studying:\n\nSocial balance theory\nCoalition formation\nConflict dynamics\nOpinion polarization\n\nHere’s an example of a signed social network like cooperative Vs. competitive ties among co-workers:\n\n\n\n\n\nSigned Social Network with Positive and Negative Relationships\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted vs Unweighted Networks\n\nWeighted Networks\nWeighted networks have edges with numerical values (weights) representing the strength, frequency, or capacity of connections. Examples include:\n\nCommunication networks (number of messages exchanged)\nTransportation networks (traffic volume or distance)\nNeural networks (synaptic strength)\nFinancial networks (transaction amounts)\n\nHere’s an example of a weighted communication network:\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted Communication Network (Edge Width = Message Volume)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnweighted Networks\nUnweighted networks (also called binary networks) have edges that simply indicate the presence or absence of a connection. All edges are treated equally, focusing on the topology rather than connection strength. These are simpler to analyze but may lose important information about relationship intensity."
