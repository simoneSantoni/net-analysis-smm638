  - Resource flow (e.g., economic exchange)
  - Information exchange (e.g., electronic communication)
  - Physical connection (e.g., London tube)
  - Membership (e.g., student-program affiliation)

Networks and graphs are interrelated yet distinct concepts: graphs are mathematical constructs, while networks regard concrete relationships between entities that can be represented using graphs
