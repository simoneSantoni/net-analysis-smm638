# Ponder the Economic Consequences of Networks

Imagine you are actively searching for a new job in your field. Reflect on your interpersonal network and consider the following:

How could your personal and professional connections help facilitate your job search?
Which specific contacts would be most valuable in this process, and why?
What makes certain connections more helpful than others? Consider factors such as:

- Their industry knowledge or position
- The strength of your relationship
- Their network and influence
- Their willingness to advocate for you
