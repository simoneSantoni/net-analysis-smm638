subtitle: "Network Analysis of Real-World Systems"
---

## Project Overview

The mid-term project is a team-based analysis of a real-world network dataset. This project allows you to apply network analytics concepts learned in the first half of the course to solve practical business problems.

### Key Information

- **Format**: Team project (3-4 students)
- **Weight**: 40% of final grade
- **Duration**: 3 weeks
- **Due Date**: Week 6
- **Deliverables**: Report + Code + Presentation

## Project Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

1. **Apply** network analysis techniques to real data
2. **Interpret** network metrics in business context
3. **Collaborate** effectively in a team setting
4. **Communicate** technical findings to non-technical audiences
5. **Develop** reproducible analysis workflows

## Dataset Options

Choose one of the following datasets or propose your own:

### 1. Corporate Board Networks
- **Data**: Board member connections across S&P 500 companies
- **Questions**: How do board interlocks affect corporate governance? Which companies are most central?
- **Source**: BoardEx or manually collected

### 2. Product Co-purchase Networks
- **Data**: Amazon product co-purchase data
- **Questions**: How can we improve recommendation systems? What product communities exist?
- **Source**: [Stanford Network Dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon-meta.html)

### 3. Social Media Influence Networks
- **Data**: Twitter follower networks or Reddit interactions
- **Questions**: Who are the key influencers? How does information spread?
- **Source**: Twitter API or Reddit dataset

### 4. Supply Chain Networks
- **Data**: Supplier-manufacturer relationships
- **Questions**: What are the vulnerabilities? How to optimize the network?
- **Source**: Industry databases or case studies

### 5. Custom Dataset
- Propose your own dataset related to your interests
- Must be approved by instructor by Week 3

## Project Requirements

## Timeline

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **Week 3** | Form teams, select dataset |
| **Week 4** | Data collection, initial analysis |
| **Week 5** | Complete analysis, write report |
| **Week 6** | Submit report, presentations |

## Tips for Success

::: {.callout-tip}
## Best Practices

1. **Start Early**: Data collection often takes longer than expected
2. **Divide Work**: Assign clear roles and responsibilities
3. **Meet Regularly**: Schedule weekly team meetings
4. **Version Control**: Use Git for collaborative coding
5. **Backup Data**: Keep multiple copies of your dataset
6. **Practice Presentation**: Rehearse before the final day
:::

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Over-complicating**: Focus on clear insights over complex methods
- **Poor Visualizations**: Ensure networks are readable and meaningful
- **Ignoring Business Context**: Always relate findings to practical applications
- **Unequal Contribution**: Use project management tools to track work
