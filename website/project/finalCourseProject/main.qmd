## Project Overview

This final project requires you to **design a comprehensive analytical
approach** to solve a real-world business problem: customer segmentation for a
music streaming platform. You will develop a research design document that
addresses how Elena Martinez, Chief Data Scientist at a European music
streaming platform, should approach a network-based customer segmentation
strategy.

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Focus: Design, Not Implementation

This project emphasizes **analytical design and strategic thinking** rather
than coding and model implementation. You are creating a blueprint for
analysis, not conducting the full analysis itself. 

:::

## Background

Traditional demographic segmentation (age, location, subscription tier) has
proven inadequate for music streaming platforms. Music preferences transcend
demographic boundaries—a 45-year-old executive might share the same taste in
electronic music as a 22-year-old student. The platform needs a better way to
segment 6 million active listeners based on their genre preferences and social
connections.

## The Business Challenge

Elena Martinez's team at a major European music streaming platform faces a
critical decision: should they move from demographic segmentation to a
genre-based, network-driven approach? If so, how should they implement it?

Elena's hypothesis is that **genres cluster naturally** based on shared
audiences and social connections. The question is how to identify these
clusters and use them for customer segmentation.

## Your Task

You will develop a **research design document** that proposes how to analyze
the Deezer platform data and address Elena's challenge. Your design should
articulate:

1. **The analytical approach** to understanding genre preferences and social connections
2. **The methodological rationale** for your proposed methods
3. **A comparison framework** for evaluating different segmentation approaches
4. **Strategic recommendations** for business implementation

## Data

You have been provided with real data from 54,573 Deezer users in Croatia:

- **Genre preferences** (`HR_genres.json`): User listening habits across 84 music genres
- **Social network** (`HR_edges.csv`): 498,202 friendship connections between users

These two data tables may help you get a better understanding of users' 
interaction patterns and preferences. You may want to use network analysis 
and conventional EDA to isolate your recommendations' premises.

## Data Location

- Genre preferences: [HR_genres.json](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638/blob/master/data/deezer/HR_genres.json)
- Social edges: [HR_edges.csv](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638/blob/master/data/deezer/HR_edges.csv)
:::

## Required Document Components

Your research design document should address the following:

### 1. Problem Framing and Context

- Explain the rationale for a network-based approach
- Define the scope and objectives of your proposed analysis

### 2. Data Representation

- Describe your approach to representing the available data
- Justify your representational choices

### 3. Methodological Design

- Propose methods for measuring relationships between genres and/or users
- Propose strategies for identifying customer segments
- Explain how you would evaluate the quality of your segmentation
- Justify your methodological choices

### 4. Comparative Analysis

- Compare different analytical approaches you could take
- Discuss trade-offs, data requirements, and expected outcomes
- Recommend which approach is most suitable and why

### 5. Business Strategy and Implementation

- Translate your technical approach into business value
- Propose validation strategies to assess impact
- Address practical implementation considerations

## Deliverable

::: {.callout-warning}
## Single Document Submission

You must submit **one discursive research design document** that addresses all
case questions.
:::

### Document Specifications

- **Format**: PDF
- **Length**: Approximately **3,000 words** (±10% acceptable)
- **Structure**: Essay format with clear sections corresponding to the required components
- **Style**: Professional business-academic writing
- **References**: Cite course materials, academic literature, and the teaching case
- **Figures/Tables**: Include conceptual diagrams where helpful (optional, do not count toward word limit)

### Distribution of Words Across Document Components

Your document should flow as a cohesive narrative, but should address:

1. Problem Framing and Context (200-300 words)
2. Data Representation (400-500 words)
3. Methodological Design (1,200-1,500 words)
4. Comparative Analysis (600-800 words)
5. Business Strategy and Implementation (400-600 words)

::: {.callout-note}
## Note on Implementation

You are **not required** to write code or implement the analysis. This is a
**design document** that proposes how the analysis should be conducted. Focus
on demonstrating your understanding of network analysis concepts and their
business application.

Familiarizing yourself with the data---by means of EDA---is recommended,
though.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission and individual presentation will be evaluated based on:

| Criterion                    | Weight   | Description                                                                                                         |

| **Conceptual Understanding** | 35%      | Depth of understanding of network analysis concepts; appropriateness of proposed methods; theoretical justification |
| **Analytical Design**        | 30%      | Quality of research design; comparison of multiple approaches; understanding of trade-offs and limitations          |
| **Business Insight**         | 25%      | Translation of technical concepts into business value; strategic thinking; practical implementation considerations  |
| **Communication**            | 10%      | Clarity and coherence of writing; logical structure; professional presentation                                      |

## Writing Guidance

## Tips for Design Documents

1. **Be specific**: Identify and name the specific methods you propose
2. **Justify your choices**: Explain why your chosen methods are appropriate for this context
3. **Consider trade-offs**: Discuss advantages and limitations of different approaches
4. **Link technical to business**: Always connect analytical choices to business objectives
5. **Be realistic**: Acknowledge data quality, computational, and organizational constraints
6. **Structure logically**: Each section should flow naturally into the next
7. **Write professionally**: Address your audience (Elena and the advisory board)

- Properly cite all sources, including course materials, academic papers, and the teaching case
- Use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for writing assistance must be disclosed in your document
- Plagiarism or inappropriate collaboration will result in academic penalties

## Tips for Success
