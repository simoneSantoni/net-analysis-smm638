## Project Overview

This final project requires you to **design a comprehensive analytical approach** to solve a real-world business problem: customer segmentation for a music streaming platform. You will develop a research design document that addresses how Elena Martinez, Chief Data Scientist at a European music streaming platform, should approach a network-based customer segmentation strategy.

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Focus: Design, Not Implementation

This project emphasizes **analytical design and strategic thinking** rather than coding and model implementation. You are creating a blueprint for analysis, not conducting the full analysis itself.
:::

## Background

Traditional demographic segmentation (age, location, subscription tier) has proven inadequate for music streaming platforms. Music preferences transcend demographic boundaries—a 45-year-old executive might share the same taste in electronic music as a 22-year-old student. The platform needs a better way to segment 6 million active listeners based on their genre preferences and social connections.

## The Business Challenge

Elena Martinez's team at a major European music streaming platform faces a critical decision: should they move from demographic segmentation to a genre-based, network-driven approach? If so, how should they implement it?

The fundamental insight is that **genres cluster naturally based on audience similarity**—genres that share overlapping listener bases tend to form communities. But there's also a social dimension: users connect with friends on the platform, and these social ties might influence genre preferences.

## Your Task

You will develop a **research design document** that proposes how to analyze the Deezer platform data and address Elena's challenge. Your design should articulate:

1. **The analytical approach** to understanding genre preferences and social connections
2. **The methodological rationale** for community detection methods
3. **A comparison framework** for evaluating different segmentation approaches
4. **Strategic recommendations** for business implementation

## Data

You have been provided with real data from 54,573 Deezer users in Croatia:

- **Genre preferences** (`HR_genres.json`): User listening habits across 84 music genres
- **Social network** (`HR_edges.csv`): 498,202 friendship connections between users

## Data Location

- Genre preferences: [HR_genres.json](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638/blob/master/data/deezer/HR_genres.json)
- Social edges: [HR_edges.csv](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638/blob/master/data/deezer/HR_edges.csv)

## Required Document Components

Your research design document should address the following:

### 1. Problem Framing and Context

- Define the scope and objectives of your proposed analysis

### 2. Data and Network Architecture

- Describe your approach to representing the available data as network(s)
- Justify your choices of network representations
- Identify relevant network properties to explore

### 3. Methodological Design

- Propose strategies for identifying communities or clusters
- Explain how you would evaluate the quality of your segmentation
- Justify your methodological choices

### 4. Comparative Analysis

- Compare different analytical approaches you could take
- Discuss trade-offs, data requirements, and expected outcomes
- Recommend which approach is most suitable and why

### 5. Business Strategy and Implementation

- Translate your technical approach into business value
- Propose validation strategies to assess impact
- Address practical implementation considerations

6. **Conclusion** (200-300 words)
   - Summary of key insights and recommendations

::: {.callout-note}
## Note on Implementation

You are **not required** to write code or implement the analysis. This is a **design document** that proposes how the analysis should be conducted. Focus on demonstrating your understanding of network analysis concepts and their business application.
:::

## Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated based on:

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Conceptual Understanding** | 35% | Depth of understanding of network analysis concepts; appropriateness of proposed methods; theoretical justification |
| **Analytical Design** | 30% | Quality of research design; comparison of multiple approaches; understanding of trade-offs and limitations |
| **Business Insight** | 25% | Translation of technical concepts into business value; strategic thinking; practical implementation considerations |
| **Communication** | 10% | Clarity and coherence of writing; logical structure; professional presentation |

## Key Questions to Address

Your analysis should answer:

::: {.callout-important}
## Core Questions

1. **How would you analyze this data to persuade the advisory board to fund the innovative, network-based approach to customer segmentation?**
   - What evidence demonstrates the limitations of demographic segmentation?
   - What insights does network analysis provide that traditional methods miss?

2. **What are the expected advantages of genre-based segmentation over demographic segmentation?**
   - How does it improve recommendation accuracy?
   - How does it enable better targeting for marketing campaigns?
   - What operational efficiencies might it create?

3. **How might the identified communities change if we include social network data?**
   - Do social connections reveal different genre communities than preference overlap alone?
   - Which approach (preference-only, network-enhanced, or dual) is most valuable?

4. **How could the platform validate whether these communities lead to better business outcomes?**
   - What metrics would you track (engagement, retention, revenue)?
   - What A/B test would you design?
   - What are the risks and limitations?
