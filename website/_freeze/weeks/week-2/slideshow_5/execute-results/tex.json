k_i$$\n\nwhere $k_i$ is the number of edges incident to node $i$\n\n**In Directed Networks:**\n\n- **In-degree** ($k_i^{in}$): Incoming connections\n- **Out-degree** ($k_i^{out}$): Outgoing connections\n\n**Normalized Degree:**\n\n$$C_D^{norm}(i) = \\frac{k_i}{n-1}$$\n\nwhere $n$ is network size\n\n---\n\n## Degree Centrality: Interpretation\n\n::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n**Undirected Networks:**\n\n- Many friends, contacts, or connections\n- High visibility and local influence\n- Direct access to information and resources\n- Potential for rapid

Interpretation {.smaller}\n\n**What High Closeness Means:**\n\n- Can quickly access information from anywhere in network\n- Efficient communication with all other nodes\n- Potential for rapid dissemination\n- Strategic position for time-sensitive activities\n\n**Applications:**\n\n- **Supply chains**: Central warehouses minimize delivery times\n- **Organizations**: Managers with high closeness coordinate efficiently\n- **Epidemic control**: High closeness nodes are early infection points\n- **Innovation**: Quick access to diverse information sources\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n\n**Limitations:** Requires connected network; sensitive to network size; ignores edge weights initially\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Closeness Example: Knowledge Networks {.smaller}\n\n:::

Proportion of shortest paths passing through a node\n\n$$C_B(i) = \\sum_{j<k} \\frac{g_{jk}(i)}{g_{jk}}$$\n\nwhere:\n\n- $g_{jk}$ = number of shortest paths between $j$ and $k$\n- $g_{jk}(i)$ = number of those paths passing through $i$\n\n**Normalized:**\n\n$$C_B^{norm}(i) = \\frac{2 \\cdot C_B(i)}{(n-1)(n-2)}$$\n\n---\n\n## Betweenness: The Broker Position {.smaller}\n\n**What High Betweenness Means:**\n\n- Controls information flow between others\n- Broker between different groups or communities\n- Can delay, distort, or facilitate communication\n- Structural hole position (Burt's theory)\n\n**Strategic Value:**\n\n- **Information arbitrage**: Access to diverse information\n- **Gatekeeping power**: Control what information passes\n- **Innovation potential**: Recombination of ideas from different groups\n- **Political capital**: Both sides need the broker\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n**Risk:** Bottleneck position—removal disrupts network flow\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Betweenness Example: Innovation Networks {.smaller}\n\n::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n\n**Pharmaceutical R&D Network**\n\n**High Betweenness Scientist (bridges Chemistry & Biology labs)**\n\n- Unique position connecting two specialized domains\n- Controls knowledge transfer between groups\n- First to see combination opportunities\n- Career advantage: Valuable to both groups\n- Organizational value: Enables cross-disciplinary projects\n\n**Low Betweenness Scientist (within dense cluster)**\n\n- Embedded in single community\n- Many redundant paths don't pass through them\n- Deep specialization possible\n- Innovation: Incremental improvements\n\n**Finding:** High betweenness predicts cross-disciplinary breakthroughs\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n\n:::

Low betweenness (embedded in group)\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Eigenvector Centrality\n\n**Definition:** Centrality proportional to sum of neighbors' centralities\n\n$$x_i = \\kappa^{-1} \\sum_{j} A_{ij} x_j$$\n\nIn matrix form: $\\mathbf{Ax} = \\kappa \\mathbf{x}$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}$ is the leading eigenvector of adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{A}$\n\n**Key Insight:** You're important if you're connected to important people\n\n**Recursive Logic:** Node centrality depends on neighbors' centrality, which depends on their neighbors' centrality, etc.\n\n---\n\n## Eigenvector Centrality: Quality vs. Quantity {.smaller}\n\n::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n**Degree vs. Eigenvector:**\n\n- **Degree**: Counts all connections equally (1 point per neighbor)\n- **Eigenvector**: Weights neighbors by their importance\n\n**Example Scenarios:**\n\n**Scenario A: High Degree, Low Eigenvector**\n\n- 50 connections to peripheral nodes\n- \"Popular among the unpopular\"\n- Volume without prestige\n\n**Scenario B: Low Degree, High Eigenvector**\n\n- 3 connections to highly central nodes\n- \"Connected to the elite\"\n- Quality over quantity\n\n:::

Network**\n\n**High Eigenvector VC Firm**\n\n- Invests alongside other prestigious VCs\n- Connected to successful entrepreneurs\n- Signals quality to market\n- Attracts top deal flow\n- Co-investment opportunities with elite partners\n\n**Low Eigenvector VC Firm**\n\n- Invests with less established partners\n- May take more risks on unproven teams\n- Less signaling value\n- Opportunity: First-mover on emerging trends\n\n**Empirical Finding:** High eigenvector centrality VCs achieve higher returns (network effects in syndication)\n\n---\n\n## Clustering Coefficient {.smaller}\n\n::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n**Definition:** Proportion of neighbors that are also connected\n\n$$C_{clust}(i) = \\frac{2e_i}{k_i(k_i-1)}$$\n\nwhere:\n\n- $k_i$ = degree of node $i$\n- $e_i$ = number of edges between neighbors of $i$\n\n**Interpretation:** How interconnected is node $i$'s neighborhood?\n\n**Range:** 0 (no neighbors connected) to 1 (all neighbors connected)\n\n**Key Insight:**\n\n- **Closed triad**: Node's neighbors are connected → High clustering\n- **Open triad**: Node's neighbors are not connected → Low clustering\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](slideshow_5_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-6-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n**Top network (Closed triad):** Node A (magenta) has clustering
