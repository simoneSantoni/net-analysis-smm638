Both advise\nJunior = [\"PhD_1\", \"PhD_2\", \"PhD_3\", \"PhD_4\"]  # All advised\n```\n\nA junior ML researcher and junior theorist:\n- **Different communities** (ML vs. Theory)\n- **Same position** (advisee role)\n\n---\n\n## On the Concept of Community\n\n\n**Intuition**\n\nA *community* is a subset of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to outsiders.\n\n**Examples**\n\n- Friendship groups in a high school\n- R&D collaboration clusters\n- Online communities\n- Scientific collaboration clusters\n\n---\n\n## The Case of Small-World Networks\n\n**Intuition**\n\nSmall worlds combine:\n\n1. **High clustering**\n2. **Short average path lengths**\n\n**Examples**\n\n- Milgram experiment  \n- Watts–Strogatz model\n\n---\n\n## The Connection Between Homophily and Small Worlds\n\nHomophily → dense cohesive groups → small-world structure\n\n---\n\n## Examples of Homophily in Small Worlds\n\n- Educational settings  \n- Study groups  \n- Cliques along demographic lines  \n\n---\n\n## Granovetter: The Strength of Weak Ties\n\n**The Paradox**\n\n\"Weak ties\" (acquaintances) provide **more novel information** than \"strong ties\" (close friends).\n\n**Why?**\n\n- Strong ties cluster together (your friends know each other)\n- Weak ties bridge to distant parts of the network\n- Information from close friends is redundant\n\n**Implication**: Bridges between communities are crucial for information flow\n\n---\n\n## Weak Ties: Visual Demonstration\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Two dense communities\nG = nx.complete_graph(10)\nH = nx.complete_graph(10)\nG = nx.disjoint_union(G, H)\n\n# Add weak tie bridges\nG.add_edges_from([(5, 15), (7, 17), (2, 12)])\n\n# Calculate betweenness\nbtw = nx.edge_betweenness_centrality(G)\n\n# Weak ties have highest betweenness!\n# They are bottlenecks for information flow\n```\n\n**Result**: Removing 3 weak ties doubles average path length\n\n---\n\n## The Case of Small-World Networks\n\n**Intuition**\n\nSmall worlds combine:\n\n1. **High clustering** (dense local neighborhoods)\n2. **Short average path lengths** (few steps between any two nodes)\n\n**Examples**\n\n- Milgram experiment (\"six degrees of separation\")\n- Watts–Strogatz model\n- Social networks, neural networks, power grids\n\n**Why it matters**: Local cohesion + global reach\n\n---\n\n## Small-World Structure Comparison\n\n| Network Type | Clustering | Path Length | Example |\n|--------------|------------|-------------|---------|\n| **Regular lattice** | High | High | Grid |\n| **Random** | Low | Low | Erdős-Rényi |\n| **Small-world** | **High** | **Low** | Real social networks |\n\nSmall-world = \"Best of both worlds\"\n\n---\n\n## Creating a Small-World Network\n\n```python\n# Watts-Strogatz model\nimport networkx as nx\n\nn = 100      # nodes\nk = 6        # neighbors\np = 0.1      # rewiring probability\n\n# Start with ring, rewire 10% of edges\nG = nx.watts_strogatz_graph(n, k, p)\n\n# Result: high clustering (like regular)\n#         + short paths (like random)\n```\n\nOnly 10% rewired edges needed to achieve small-world property!\n\n---\n\n## The Connection Between Homophily and Small Worlds\n\nHomophily (similarity-based tie formation):\n- Creates **dense cohesive groups** (high clustering)\n- But a few cross-group ties (weak ties) → **short paths**\n\nResult: Small-world structure emerges naturally\n\n**Examples**\n- Educational settings (study groups by major, occasional cross-major friendships)\n- Organizational networks (departments cluster, management bridges)\n\n---\n\n## Definitions of Network Communities\n\n\n- **Strong**\n- **Weak**\n- **Density-based operational definitions**\n\n---\n\n## Example of Communities in a Strong Sense\n\nStrongly cohesive groups, nearly clique-like.\n\n---\n\n## Example of Communities in a Weak Sense\n\nHigh internal density but not complete; overlapping clusters.\n\n---\n\n## Most Popular Community Detection Algorithms\n\n- Louvain  \n- Leiden  \n- Girvan–Newman  \n- Spectral clustering  \n- Walktrap / Label propagation  \n\n---\n\n## The Connection between Network Communities and Modularity\n\nDefinition of modularity; modularity maximization.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding Modularity\n\n**What is Modularity (Q)?**\n\nMeasures if a partition has more **within-group edges** than expected by chance.\n\n$$Q = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{ij} \\left[A_{ij} - \\frac{k_i k_j}{2m}\\right] \\delta(c_i, c_j)$$\n\n- $A_{ij}$ = observed edge\n- $\\frac{k_i k_j}{2m}$ = expected edge (null model)\n- $\\delta(c_i, c_j)$ = 1 if same community, 0 otherwise\n\n---\n\n## Modularity Interpretation\n\n| Q Value | Interpretation |\n|---------|----------------|\n| **Q < 0.3** | No meaningful community structure |\n| **Q = 0.3-0.7** | Significant community structure |\n| **Q > 0.7** | Very strong divisions (rare) |\n\n**Rule of thumb**: Q > 0.4 indicates good community detection\n\n---\n\n## Most Popular Community Detection Algorithms\n\n| Algorithm | Objective | Speed | Best Use |\n|-----------|-----------|-------|----------|\n| **Louvain** | Modularity max | Fast | General purpose |\n| **Leiden** | Improved modularity | Fast | Quality + speed |\n| **Walktrap** | Random walks | Medium | Multi-scale |\n| **Girvan-Newman** | Edge betweenness | Slow | Hierarchical, small networks |\n| **Label Propagation** | Local consensus | Very fast | Large networks, unstable |\n\n**Recommendation**: Start with Louvain or Leiden\n\n---\n\n## Resolution Parameter\n\nMany algorithms have a **resolution** parameter controlling granularity:\n\n```python\n# Higher resolution → more, smaller communities\ncommunities_fine = louvain(G, resolution=2.0)  # 8 communities\n\n# Default resolution\ncommunities_default = louvain(G, resolution=1.0)  # 4 communities\n\n# Lower resolution → fewer, larger communities  \ncommunities_coarse = louvain(G, resolution=0.5)  # 2 communities\n```\n\n**Choice depends on your research question**\n\n---\n\n## Community Detection Algorithms in Action\n\n\nR-style examples and workflow.\n\n---\n\n## Part II: Roles and Positions\n\n---\n\n## Definitions\n\n**Role**: Set of nodes with similar structural functions  \n**Position**: Pattern of relations defining a node's structural location  \n\n---\n\n## Rendering Roles in Network Data\n\nIntuition, approaches, use cases.\n\n---\n\n## Rendering Roles: Algorithms\n\nBlockmodeling, equivalence types, clustering.\n\n---\n\n## Rendering Positions in Network Data\n\nTriad profiles, multiplexity, centrality patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Rendering Positions: Algorithms\n\nSimilarity matrices, clustering, blockmodels.\n\n---\n\n## Structural Equivalence: Definition\n\n**Two nodes are structurally equivalent if they have identical ties to the same alters**\n\nExample:\n- Node A connects to: {C, D, E}\n- Node B connects to: {C, D, E}\n- → A and B are structurally equivalent\n\n**Implication**: They are **substitutable** - occupy the same position\n\n---\n\n## Types of Equivalence\n\n| Type | Definition | Example |\n|------|------------|---------|\n| **Structural** | Identical ties to same alters | Two salespeople serving same clients |\n| **Regular** | Similar types of ties | All managers supervise someone |\n| **Automorphic** | Topologically identical | Symmetry in graph |\n\nMost common in practice: **Structural equivalence**\n\n---\n\n## Measuring Structural Equivalence\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import pdist, squareform\n\n# Adjacency matrix\nA = [[0, 1, 1, 0],\n     [1, 0, 1, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 1],\n     [0, 0, 1, 0]]\n\n# Correlation distance (1 - correlation)\n# Nodes with similar tie profiles have high correlation\ncorr = np.corrcoef(A)\nequivalence = corr  # Higher = more equivalent\n```\n\n---\n\n## Rendering Roles in Network Data\n\n**From actors to positions**\n\n1. Calculate similarity matrix (correlation or Euclidean distance)\n2. Apply hierarchical clustering\n3. Cut dendrogram to get positions\n4. Interpret role meanings\n\n**Result**: Reduced representation (30 actors → 4 positions)\n\n---\n\n## Blockmodeling: Image Matrices\n\n**Blockmodel** reduces network to position-level interactions\n\n**Example**: 30-person organization → 3 positions (Senior, Mid, Junior)\n\n**Image Matrix** (3×3):\n```\n           Senior  Mid  Junior\nSenior  [   0.8   0.6   0.3  ]\nMid     [   0.4   0.5   0.7  ]\nJunior  [   0.1   0.6   0.4  ]\n```\n\nInterpretation: Senior staff advise all levels, juniors mainly interact with mid-level\n\n---\n\n## CONCOR Algorithm\n\n**CONvergence of iterated CORrelations**\n\n1. Calculate correlation matrix of node profiles\n2. Correlate the correlation matrix  \n3. Repeat until convergence\n4. Split based on sign of first eigenvector\n\n**Why it works**: Iterating amplifies structural patterns\n\n**Result**: Hierarchical partition (can split recursively)\n\n---\n\n## Rendering Positions: Algorithms\n\n**Methods for finding positions**:\n\n1. **Correlation-based clustering**\n   - Correlate row (or column) profiles\n   - Hierarchical clustering\n\n2. **Euclidean distance clustering**\n   - Calculate Euclidean distance between profiles\n   - Ward linkage clustering\n\n3. **CONCOR** (classical approach)\n\n**Choice**: Correlation for directed networks, Euclidean for valued networks\n\n---\n\n## Communities vs. Positions: Key Differences\n\n| Dimension | Communities | Positions |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Basis** | Direct ties | Tie patterns |\n| **Logic** | Cohesion | Equivalence |\n| **Question** | Who interacts with whom? | Who plays similar roles? |\n| **Example** | Research groups | Hierarchical levels |\n| **Solidarity** | Mechanical | Organic |\n\n**Both are valid, complementary perspectives**\n\n---\n\n## When Communities ≠ Positions\n\n**Example**: Corporate structure\n\n- **Communities**: Departments (Marketing, R&D, Finance)\n- **Positions**: Ranks (Executives, Managers, Staff)\n\nA Marketing Manager and an R&D Manager:\n- **Different communities** (different departments)\n- **Same position** (both supervise, both report up)\n\n**Adjusted Rand Index**: Measures overlap (0 = independent, 1 = identical)\n\n---\n\n## Wrap up\n\n\nCommunities = cohesion  \nRoles/positions = equivalence  \n\n",
