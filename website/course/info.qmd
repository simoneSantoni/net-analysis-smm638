## Course Overview

IND215 - Introduction to R for Analytics is designed specifically for MSc
students in analytics who want to develop practical programming skills for
data analysis. This course provides a foundation in R programming with a focus
on statistical computing, data manipulation, and the tidyverse ecosystem.

## Learning Philosophy

This course takes a practical, hands-on approach to learning R. Rather than
covering every aspect of the language, we focus on the fundamental concepts
and packages that analytics professionals use daily:

- **Practical Focus**: Learn by doing with real-world examples and exercises
- **Analytics-Oriented**: Emphasis on statistical thinking, data manipulation, and visualization
- **Progressive Learning**: Build skills incrementally from basic R concepts to tidyverse mastery
- **Modern Tools**: Use current best practices and the tidyverse ecosystem

## Course Structure

The course is organized into four substantive modules:

### Module 1: Getting Started with R
- R and RStudio installation and setup
- R as a calculator and basic operations
- Understanding the RStudio interface
- Creating and managing R scripts and projects

### Module 2: R Fundamentals
- Objects, assignment, and basic data types
- Vectors, lists, and data frames
- Factors and their importance in statistical analysis
- Control structures (if statements, loops) and functions
- File handling and data import/export

### Module 3: Introduction to Tidyverse
- Understanding the tidyverse philosophy
- Data import with readr
- Basic data manipulation with dplyr
- Data tidying principles with tidyr

### Module 4: Data Wrangling with dplyr
- Filtering, selecting, and arranging data
- Creating new variables with mutate
- Grouping and summarizing data
- Joining datasets and advanced data manipulation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Set up and manage R environments** for data analysis projects using RStudio
2. **Write clean, efficient R code** following tidyverse principles and best practices
3. **Manipulate and analyze data** using base R and tidyverse functions
4. **Process and transform datasets** using dplyr for data wrangling
5. **Import and export data** from various file formats using readr and base R
6. **Create reproducible data analysis workflows** with R scripts and R Markdown
7. **Apply statistical thinking** to data exploration and basic analysis tasks

## Prerequisites

- **No prior programming experience required**
- Basic computer literacy (file management, using applications)
- Willingness to learn through trial and error
- Access to a computer for hands-on practice

## Software Requirements

- **R 4.0+** (we recommend R 4.3 or newer)
- **RStudio Desktop** (latest version for the best experience)
- **Essential R packages** (tidyverse, readr, dplyr, ggplot2, and others)
- **Git** for version control (optional but recommended)

## Assessment and Practice

This course emphasizes practical skill development through:

- **Interactive exercises** embedded in each module
- **Hands-on coding assignments** using real datasets
- **Progressive projects** that build on previous concepts
- **Self-assessment opportunities** to check understanding

## Getting Help

- Use the course materials and examples as your first reference
- Practice with the provided exercises and datasets
- Consult Python documentation and community resources
- Ask questions during class sessions or office hours

## Success Tips

1. **Practice regularly**: Programming is a skill that improves with consistent practice
2. **Start small**: Begin with simple examples and gradually tackle more complex problems
3. **Read error messages**: They often contain helpful information about what went wrong
4. **Use online resources**: The R community has excellent documentation and tutorials
5. **Don't be afraid to experiment**: Try different approaches and see what works
6. **Think in data frames**: Most R operations work naturally with tabular data
