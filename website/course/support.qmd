**Instructor**: [erwanghao.yu@bayes.city.ac.uk](mailto:erwanghao.yu@bayes.city.ac.uk)

**When to email**:

- Personal matters (illness, accommodations)
- Scheduling appointments
- Urgent technical issues
- Administrative questions

**Response time**: 24-48 hours on weekdays

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Installation Problems

::: {.callout-warning}
**Common Installation Issues**:

**Problem**: R/RStudio won't install

- **Quick fix attempt**: Check system requirements, disable antivirus temporarily, run as administrator

**Problem**: Python packages won't install

- **Quick fix attempt**: Update conda/pip, check firewall settings, try different repository

**Problem**: Network analysis packages won't import

- **Quick fix attempt**: Verify installation with `library()` in R or `import` in Python, reinstall package, check dependencies (igraph, networkx, etc.)

### Network Analysis Challenges

**"I don't know where to start with network analysis"**:

1. Start with simple network visualizations
2. Understand your data structure (nodes and edges)
3. Begin with basic centrality measures
4. Use sample networks before your own data
5. Look at similar network examples in the literature

**"My network code doesn't work"**:

1. Check your data format (edge list, adjacency matrix)
2. Verify node and edge attributes
3. Ensure proper package loading (igraph, networkx)
4. Test with small sample networks first
5. Check for isolated nodes or missing edges

**"I don't understand network concepts"**:

1. Review the network terminology glossary
2. Practice with interactive network examples
3. Visualize concepts with simple networks
4. Ask specific questions on the forum
5. Attend office hours with concrete examples

- Discuss makeup options
- Don't fall behind

## FAQ

**Q: How much time should I spend on this course?**
A: Plan for 2-3 hours outside class for every hour in class (6-9 hours/week total).

**Q: Do I need prior programming experience?**
A: Basic programming experience in R or Python is helpful but not required. We'll cover the essentials for network analysis.

**Q: Can I use AI tools like ChatGPT?**
A: You may use them for learning and understanding concepts, but submitted work must be your own. Always cite any AI assistance received.

**Q: What if I'm falling behind?**
A: Seek help immediately. Network analysis concepts build on each other, so early gaps become bigger problems later.

**Q: Do I need a powerful computer?**
A: No, basic network analysis doesn't require much computing power. Any computer from the last 5 years should work fine.

**Q: Should I use R or Python for network analysis?**
A: Both are excellent. We'll primarily use R with igraph, but Python with NetworkX is also supported. Choose based on your comfort level.

## Success Tips

::: {.callout-tip}

**Top tips from successful network analysis students**:

1. **Start with simple networks** - Build complexity gradually
2. **Visualize first** - Always plot your networks to understand structure
3. **Think about the domain** - Network interpretation depends on context
4. **Practice with real data** - Work with networks from your field of interest
5. **Learn the terminology** - Master key concepts like centrality, clustering, paths
6. **Ask "why" questions** - Don't just calculate metrics, understand their meaning
7. **Document your analysis** - Network studies require clear interpretation
8. **Compare measures** - Different centrality metrics tell different stories
