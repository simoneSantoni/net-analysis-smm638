# Problem set 1

The first problem set is conceptual in nature. Consider the SMM638 class and address the following:

- identify three relevant relationships that can be used to appreciate as many networks
- for each network, indicate the form (directed/undirected; weighted/unweighted; one-mode/two-mode)
- explain the outcomes that are most likely associated with each network

Please send me your solution via email by Mon 18 (8:00 PM). Let me stress problem sets are not mandatory.
