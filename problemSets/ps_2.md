# Problem set 2

Use pure Python code and/or NumPy and/or NetworkX to create a collection of functions that compute and print to the screen the following:

- the diameter of a network
- summary stats concerning path length
- summary stats concerning the shortest path lenght

Then, use NetworkX (see [`graph generators`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generators.html#module-networkx.generators.random_graphs)) to simulate two networks with 1000 nodes. Specifically, you're supposed to simulate a random graph (see the function `random_regular_graph`) and a small-world graph (see the function `watts_strogatz_graph`)

Finally, apply your functions over the two simulated networks.

Good luck! You need a decent amount for this problem set 😈
