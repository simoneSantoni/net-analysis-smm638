# Problem Set 1 ― README

**Task:** The problem set comprises three points (all have to be addressed):

1.   Use NumPy to simulate two, 1-mode, unweighted, and undirected networks
     with 100 nodes. A first network G_ld should have average degree = 3, while
     a second network G_hd should have average degree = 8.
2.   Use NumPy to simulate a 1-mode, unweighted, and undirected network
     with 1000 nodes. This synthetic network should have the following
     degree distribution:

k  | p(k)
---|-----
0  | 0
1  | 0.1
2  | 0.35
3  | 0.25
4  | 0.2
5  | 0.1
6  | 0.04
7  | 0.01
8  | 0.02
9  | 0.02
10 | 0.01

3.   Use NumPy to simulate a 2-mode, unweighted network wherein the actors
     of the first mode exhibit the following degree distribution:

k  | p(k)
---|-----
0  | 0.1
1  | 0.1
2  | 0.35
3  | 0.25
4  | 0.2
