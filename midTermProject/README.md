# Mid-term project — README

![](images/communities.png)

The MTP revolves around the topic of network modularity, and, especially 
communities and core-peripehery structure (see 
[week 3](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638/blob/e75c31ac89c976cd4dbd4d6175315d0272149384/lectureNotes/week3) of the module).

## Description of the project

Students — working in groups — are supposed:

1. to get access to a network dataset to put at the center of the MTP. There are
two options to do that: reusing data available in digital repositories, e.g.,
[SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html) or
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), or gathering data _ex-novo_ (e.g., using a
crawler 🕸🕷). Inter-personal, inter-organizational, technological, and physical
networks are admitted types of networks for the MTP

2. to identify the relationhsip(s) included in the selected network dataset and
to appreciate the economic, organizational, managerial, and/or social relevance
of the relationship(s)

3. to use Python:
   1. to analyze and plot the degree distribution of the network
   2. to plot the network
   3. to produce descriptive statistics about relevant node-level properties 
      (e.g., betweeness centrality)
   4. to asssess how and to what extent the network shows a modular structure
      (e.g., a community or core-periphery structure)
   5. to assess the consequences of the modular structure for 
      the individual nodes, the individual communities, and/or the functioning
      of the network. For example, one may want to correlate the network position of an individual (core Vs. periphery) with her attitudes, behavior, preferences.

4. to produce a companion document that — in plain English — describes and
comments  the outcome of the previous point 3.i - 3.v. 

## Deliverables

By Nov 15 (5:00 PM), students are supposed to submit the following package:

- [ ] Python 🐍 code behind 3.i - 3.v
- [ ] a companion document in .pdf format. No word limit applies; however, I
      really appreciate documents with a high added value per page (see
      the bestseller [How to Write Short](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Write-Short-Craft-Times-ebook/dp/B00FOQRPT4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=how+to+write+short&qid=1634742402&sr=8-1))  
- [ ] a 10-frame slideshow that summarizes the project (needed if you're 
  selected to present your project to the class).

Submission will be evaluated against the assessment criteria reported in the 
[README](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638/blob/fc0734ec21132e03823b951811aee0034c70c6af/README.md) file of the repo.
