## Why a Network Analytics course?

Networks are ubiquitous: job offerings reach us via inter-personal connections;
what we see on the screen of our digital device is a function of the
relationships we develop in the digital world; market valuations are — largely —
the byproduct of social influence, which accumulates and spreads over relations.
This module provides students with cutting-edge network theories and practical
tools to appreciate the organization and functioning of disparate networks.
Ultimately, the goal is to develop a distinctive angle on how networks bring
value to individuals, organizations, and communities.

## Learning Objectives

In terms of learning objectives, by the end of the module, students will be
able to:

- Appreciate the properties of networks;
- Appreciate the properties of communities of nodes belonging to a network;
- Appreciate the properties of individual nodes belonging to a network;
- Visually represent the key features of networks;
- Leverage the most advanced Python modules for network analytics;
- Mobilize key network analytics notions and tools to produce
  elegant, effective, and efficient solutions to practical problems in
  the field of business analytics.
