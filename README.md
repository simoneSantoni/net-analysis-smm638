## Why a Network Analytics course?

Networks are ubiquitous: job offerings reach us via inter-personal connections;
what we see on the screen of our digital device is a function of the
relationships we develop in the digital world; market valuations are --- largely ---
the byproduct of social influence, which accumulates and spreads over relations.
This module provides students with cutting-edge network theories and practical
tools to appreciate the organization and functioning of disparate networks.
Ultimately, the goal is to develop a distinctive angle on how networks bring
value to individuals, organizations, and communities.
